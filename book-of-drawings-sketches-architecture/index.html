The Book Of Drawings &#43; Sketches: Architecture: Architecture | Braun Publishing From braun-publishing.ch
This book asks, fundamentally, whether drawings can illuminate new interpretations of architectural experimentation. After the success of architectural visions, with its focus on the german speaking countries, this volume is devoted to the individual handwriting of architects and designers from around the world. Below, we compiled a list of 100 sketches made by architects. As creative designers, architects are interested in how other architects, particularly successful ones, think through the use of drawings to approach their work.
