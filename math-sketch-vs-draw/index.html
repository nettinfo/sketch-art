Indeed, sketching in desmos is like drawing with two hands (or maybe the legs as well) tied, even though a voice deep inside us is saying that this is only good for the cause of mathematics. Deep drawing of a cuboid *a cuboid is a 3dimensional (3d) shape. To sketch this information into the direction field, we navigate to the coordinate point ( x, y) (x,y) ( x, y), and then sketch a tiny line that has slope equal to the corresponding value y ′ y' y ′.</p>
