My ultimate goal is to make a drawing that leads to two equally relevant interpretations: The ambiguity of sketches ensures that referential contents of ideas during the early phases of design are indeterminate, and that ideas are unfreeze during design development. Regardless of which orientation you saw first, if you study the two figures with the dotted lines, and visualize each orientation in three dimensions, you should be able to look back at the.
