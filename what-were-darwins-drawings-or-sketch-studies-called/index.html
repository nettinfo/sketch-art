Drawings &amp; Paintings by Jonathan Aller &#34;Charles Darwin&#34; From jonaller.blogspot.com
Pencil drawing, drawing executed with an instrument composed of graphite enclosed in a wood casing and intended either as a sketch for a more elaborate work in another medium, an exercise in visual expression, or a finished work. Darwin&#39;s finches (also known as the galápagos finches) are a group of about 18 species of passerine birds. Drawings can be studies for later paintings or sculptures as well as being an art form on their own. Later single celled, multicellular and invertebrates were formed.
