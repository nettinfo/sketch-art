<p>Epithelium also forms much of the glandular tissue of the body. The subject is overwhelming for most, especially those not familiar with it, so the concept map can be useful to simplify this complex process. Most epithelial tissues are essentially large sheets of cells covering all the surfaces of the body exposed to the outside world and lining the outside of organs. A cell can replicate itself independently. 5,106 Metabolism Illustrations &amp; Clip Art - Istock.</p>
