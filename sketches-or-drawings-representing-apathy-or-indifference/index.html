In economics, an indifference curve is a line drawn between different consumption bundles, on a graph charting the quantity of good a consumed versus the quantity of good b consumed. By drawing a diagonal line from the origin, it is possible to label indifference curves, i.e., to label to each indifference curve to show how far it is from the origin, measured along the diagonal line, so long as preferences are monotonic.
