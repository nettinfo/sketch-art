Quia Review of Types of Sketches/Drawings From quia.com
The horizontal plane is the projection plane that projects the top view of an object. As nouns the difference between sketch and drawing is that sketch is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not intended as a finished work, often consisting of a multitude of overlapping lines while drawing is a picture,. (a) an oblique sketch does not have proportional lengths. • pictorial drawings often are more readily made and more clearly understood than are front, top, and side views of an object.
