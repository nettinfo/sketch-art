<p>It may be a bit dated but i am using autocad 2002 and at the moment have no real need to update, however just recently i have been asked if i can make a cad drawing look like it has been hand drawn, i have seen other people ask the same question but i don't completely understand the answers as they mention comands such as 'sketch' and 'freehand' which i can't.
