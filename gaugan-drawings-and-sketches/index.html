<p>🖌 photorealistic drawings from simple sketches using nvidia's gaugan Nvidia has announced the development of gaugan, a smart drawing app that helps artists create photorealistic images from simple doodles and sketches. Gaugan allows users to draw their own segmentation maps and manipulate the scene, labeling each segment with labels like sand, sky, sea or snow. Gauguin loved to sketch local people in whichever region he was living at the time, be it provincial france or in some of the exotic destinations in which he spent time across his life.</p>

<p>Visual computing company nvidia recently showed off a new piece of software called gaugan (get it?) that can turn crude sketches into artfully crafted digital paintings. Nvidia gaugan ai transforms scratch scribbles into photorealistic images. An application that is now still in its infancy, but might have a huge impact on diverse fields in the future, such as designers. Gaugan uses deep learning and generative.
