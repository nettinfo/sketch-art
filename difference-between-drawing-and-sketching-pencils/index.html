5 years difference! A comparison of my pencil sketches From pinterest.com
A drawing is a more detailed approach to creating a picture and the drawing becomes the finished piece of work. One of the main ways artists get better at drawing is by studying many different subjects and understanding how to represent them. The plebeian assumption would be that a sketch is an incomplete work meant as reference for a more finished piece. The main difference between a sketch and drawing is that sketches will have less detail, be completed quickly, have simpler forms, and will generally focus on one aspect when compared to a more detailed drawing.
