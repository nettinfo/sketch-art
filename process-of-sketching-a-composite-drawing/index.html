<p>Fully automatic, the composite sketches used were created while viewing the mugshot photograph (viewed composite sketches) which does not reﬂect operational scenarios. Sketching is a type of drawing that allows designers and artists to explore concepts in multiple styles. The different types of drawings are associated with different stages of the process with one type, the relatively unstructured and ambiguous sketch, occurring early in the process. The fabrication methodology of a composite part depends mainly on three factors:</p>
