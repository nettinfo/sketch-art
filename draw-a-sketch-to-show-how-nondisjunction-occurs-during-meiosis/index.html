Chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane dissolves.mitosis: As learned, the tetrads separate in meiosis i and the sister chromatids separate in meiosis ii. This is the most common reason for many syndromes or genetic defects in humans. The possible types of gametes that a diploid organism can produce are 1n, 1n, 2n, 1n, and 2n, that is, each gamete can be either haploid or diploid.
