Generative Adversarial Networks and Several Typical From researchgate.net
Generative adversarial networks or gans are used in drawing or sketching some figures, to be precise it is used for generating an output that is fairly distinctive from the input dataset. To achieve this goal, first, we propose a new attribute classification loss. An image generation system using gan to turn face sketches into realistic photos. Sketchgan, a new generative adversarial network (gan) based approach that jointly completes and recognizes a sketch,boostingtheperformanceofbothtasks.

<p>Gans (generative adversarial networks) are a form of unsupervised learning neural network. There are two major components within gans: We are going to build a conditional generative adversarial network which accepts a 256x256 px black and white sketch image and predicts the colored version of the image without knowing the ground truth. Zhu and others (2016) developed an interactive application called interactive generative adversarial networks (igan). 5 New Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Architectures.</p>
