Linear position sensing using a Linear Voltage From eleceng.dit.ie
The two secondary winding have equal number of turns and placed identically on either side of the primary winding as shown in figure below. The displacement to be measured is applied at its arm attached to soft iron core. This design has been used throughout many decades for the accurate measurement of displacement and within closed loops for the control of positioning. Hi friends, in this article, i am going to discuss about lvdt working principle, lvdt advantages and disadvantages.my article will increase your knowledge, i hope so.

The both the rvdt and lvdt workings are similar, but lvdt employs the flexible iron core for displacement measurement whereas in rvdt employs a cam type core. An lvdt transducer or lvdt is a miniature transformer having an armature core and a shaft that is free to move in a linear axis. It converts the rectilinear displacement of any object to which it is coupled mechanically in electrical signal proportional to it. Figure Drawing Foundations Proportions FlippedNormals.</p>

<p>An lvdt is one of several functions of lvdt support electronics, which is also sometimes known as lvdt signal conditioning equipment. The term lvdt stands for the linear variable differential transformer. The output across secondary of this transformer is the differential thus it is called so. Linear variable differential transformer (lvdt) it is also known as an inductive transformer, is defined as a process used for measuring displacement in instrumentation systems.

<p>Lvdt is defined as a sensor which converts a nonlinear motion to an electrical signal. It works on the principle of mutual inductance, that generates an electrical signal proportional to the physical quantity applied which is to be measured. A carefully manufactured lvdt can provide an output linear within ±0.25% over a range of core motion, with very fine resolution. Linear variable differential transformer (lvdt) it is also known as an inductive transformer, is defined as a process used for measuring displacement in instrumentation systems.
