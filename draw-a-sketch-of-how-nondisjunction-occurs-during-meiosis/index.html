<p>Abnormal karyotypes arise from mistakes in meiosis, specifically from nondisjunction during meiosis i or meiosis ii. Suppose an egg is produced in which none of the chromosomes separate during meiosis ii. During meiosis ii, each of the two daughter cells produced during meiosis i undergo a second round of meiosis, going from diploid (two pairs of each chromosome) to haploid (one of each chromosome). If one of these gametes fertilizes another gamete, then the resulting offspring will not have the correct number of chromosomes</p>

Nondisjunction occurs when some aspect of the spindle assembly checkpoint (sac) fails. Aneuploidy usually involves a single chromosome, but in rare. Meiotic nondisjunction errors are common in humans, resulting in aneuploidy, a term used when the total number of chromosomes in a cell is not an exact multiple of the haploid number. in Eukaryotes Meiosis.</p>

<p>In some cases of nondisjunction, a single chromosome fails to separate. One cell is produced with both homologues and the other cell has no copies of this chromosome. For example, take a look the meiosis ii diagram above, which shows the products of meiosis for a cell with 2 n = 4 2n = 4 2 n = 4 chromosomes.
