<p>The way that solidworks works is that if the sketch is set to âshowâ, in other words, if the sketch was not hidden in the part level, it will show in all drawing views at the drawing level. This sketched geometry can be controlled by relations (collinear, parallel, tangent, and so on), as well as parametric dimensions. Click sketch picture (sketch toolbar) or insert &gt; picture. Solidworks lets you specify the color of paper, borders, lines, and sketches as well as allowing you to customize the colors of sketch lines in a part file.</p>
