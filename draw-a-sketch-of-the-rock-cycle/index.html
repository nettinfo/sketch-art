<p>The rock cycle is a concept used to explain how the three basic rock types are related and how earth processes, over geologic time, change a rock from one type into another. Rock is an aggregation of different minerals. Igneous rock can be metamorphosed directly into metamorphic rock, and metamorphic rock can turn directly to sediment. In this sciencestruck article, we have explained the rock cycle in detail. to Earth Science A! Science in 226!.</p>
