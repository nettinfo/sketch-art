Treatment facilities are often engineered to utilize gravity water flow as much as possible to reduce pumping costs. The water treatment process generally adopted depends upon the quality of raw water and the quality of water derived. The 5 major unit processes include chemical coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection (described below).
