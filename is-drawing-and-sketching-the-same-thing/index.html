Ballpoint pen drawing of a figure with two faces emerging From pinterest.com.mx
What i learned by drawing the same thing for 100 days. Drawing takes more time and contains a lot more detail. The main difference is that drawing is a technique where pictures are depicted by lines and painting is a technique where pictures are depicted by applying color to a surface. It was a way to love the process of making and not so much about the goal of creating one beautiful thing.
