The sketch is fully defined if the lines on the sketch are all black. All your drawings must be fully dimensioned to enable builders to construct and build the drawn object. If you are just creating a one time part, and your end product is a dimensioned drawing, i see no reason to require the designer to fully constrain the sketch. Attached is a pdf of an example.

<p>There is one more way to tell. In some cases, however, the centerline of the wall might be located and dimensioned. Whenever i use the dimension tool the scale goes out so it’s not very visible once printed. They way it accomplishes this is by adding weak dimensions and constraints.</p>

<p>The sketch is fully defined if the lines on the sketch are all black. All you have to do is use the select tool to put things where you want them. A unconstrained sketch is one which does not have a single solution for the given constraints/dimensions i.e a different shape could be expressed using the same set of constraints. One of the things i liked about pro/engineer is that this was virtually impossible since all sketches must be fully dimensioned and by simply showing all part parameters on the drawing you were guaranteed of having a fully dimensioned drawing with no missing dimensions.

<p>Submit a screenshot of your dimension constrained sketch (6 pts) 2. I’d like to be able to show a couple of views on my 3d model to remind me of construction, then create detail part drawings from that construction fully dimensioned. Once the reference sketch containing the sketch picture is in place, the sketches for the body outline and all the features representing the machining operations for the body are created by tracing over the original reference sketch in sketches of their own. When a sketch is over dimensioned, it just simply has repeated dimensions on. The Nerdy Side I Love Of My Life panosundaki Pin.</p>
