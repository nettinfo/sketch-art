Draw together with a neural network. These doodles are a unique data set that can help developers train new neural networks, help researchers see patterns in how people around the world draw, and help artists create things we haven’t begun to think of. This code is configured to use bicycle dataset. The game asks the user to draw a picture of an object or idea and uses a neural network artificial intelligence to guess what the sketch represents.
