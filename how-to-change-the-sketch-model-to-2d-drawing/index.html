<p>You can create drawing geometry using 2d sketched geometry only, without reference to existing models or assemblies. Specifically turn off all text and dimensions and their leader lines so that they do not import as linework. Using sketch mode, along with constraints and dimensions, you can draw plane geometry and define relations between the geometric entities that you draw. To create a 2d drawing view of a part or assembly, you can convert a 3d part view or you can draw the 2d graphics yourself. [challenge] test your skills! How fast can you transform.</p>
