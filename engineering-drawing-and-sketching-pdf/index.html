CATIA Exercise Book.pdf Technical drawing, Solidworks From pinterest.com
This book will cover the field of engineering theory, analysis, design, and practice known as mechanisms, also known as kinematics, and dynamics of machines. Engineering drawing plays a crucial role in the life of every mechanical engineering student because he has to bear that subject throughout his btech. • isometric drawing is important to engineering designers as the drawing shows clearly what that has been designed • it is also useful for equipment designers as they can easily interpret the method of construction of an object or equipment. Exercise •complete three orthographic views of the object shown on the next slide.
