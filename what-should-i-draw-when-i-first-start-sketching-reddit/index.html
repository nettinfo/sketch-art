<p>Sketch your figure quickly, paying attention to the pose and posture. Then, when you go draw stuff from your head, start with gesture first. The key here is balance.

<p>I think you should do whatever you want. A professional drawing takes dozens of hours of work time. For some, it’s a matter of interest, but often that dropoff is fueled by a belief that an ability to draw is an innate talent. Use the gesture sketch as a suggestion to draw the structure over it.

<p>After level 4 you should be able to draw anything from a reference, but if you really want to create, this is where the really hard work must begin.

<p>Don’t ever assume that the first thing you draw is the final. Look at the first image you draw and then the last image you drew. I’ve been drawing traditionally my entire life so far…i started drawing digitally over the last year, and while my art isnt superb right now, i do like where i’m headed.
