<p>I would suggest making devour duration based, something like 5. Funnily enough, i went for a kuva look on my own inaros, it actually really goes with his lines he makes a somewhat convincing grineer with the right colours.

<p>Regarding inaros and nidus, i find that as long as you have scarab armor and some energy, you're basically unkillable, same with nidus and his stacks; I would suggest making devour duration based, something like 5. Now that you mention it, i do have an idea for a warframe that has been sitting on my drawing board for a long time now inspired by slavic mythology, the god named triglav or troglav.

<p>Inaros was the first warframe to have 0 base shield, with nidus following after. It drains faster the further you progress in eso. So, anyway, i got the reflex guard mod and put it on and raised it a few levels, but it seems like you can only use it if you commit to using only your melee weapons because with everyone shooting at me i just stay in parry mode. The skull has been a very powerful symbol in human cultures, whether to commemorate ancestors or as a warning of our mortality. Pin by Â·Â·Â· Â·Â· Â·Â· Â· Â· Â·Â·Â· Â·Â· Â· on WarFrame.</p>
