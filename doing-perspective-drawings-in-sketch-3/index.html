Camera clipping plane is a necessary display optimization where the computer only draws things that might be visible to the viewer, thereby reducing the rendering load and greatly speeding up the application. It is the simplest type of perspective since we have only one vanishing point and one of the most used in interior drawing. Image result for sectional perspective sketchup detail.</p>
