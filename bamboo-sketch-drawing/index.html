How To Draw Bamboo: 8 Steps (With Pictures) | Bamboo Drawing, Tree Drawings Pencil, Tree Drawing Simple From pinterest.com
Keep the precision stylus ready for your ideas in a slim and lightweight carrying case that fits your pocket and includes storage for the pen, extra nibs and the usb charger. Its a really good choice if you have an earlier gen ipad or if you dont want to shell out the $100 for the apple pencil. When you start using the bamboo the ink runs out quickly, and the lines are shore, but as you continue the pen will absorb more ink and the lines will be longer. That is when the fun begins.
