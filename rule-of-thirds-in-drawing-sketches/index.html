The rule of thirds Abstract landscape, Culture art From br.pinterest.com
The rule of thirds states that elements within a composition will potentially appear more harmonious, balanced, and aesthetically pleasing if they coincide with a number of geometrically determined points. From there, you can start sketching and placing the elements of your drawing, taking into account the effect of those points with a higher power of attraction. The rule of thirds states that the centers of interest for any rectangle lie somewhere along those lines. The guideline proposes that an image should be imagined as divided into nine equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, and that important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their.
