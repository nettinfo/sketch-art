<p>Concept sketches are sketches or diagrams that are concisely annotated with short statements that describe the processes, concepts, and interrelationships shown in the sketch. In this pilot study we attempt to discover when drawing design by hand on paper can be better or more efficient than conventional methods, for developing physical prototypes with laser cutting in the context of early stage product development. To increase my creativity while i sketch concept art engine, i feed my memory of forms. Compare the power of the convex and concave lenses so that the image formed is real.
