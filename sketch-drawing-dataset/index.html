GitHub googlecreativelab/quickdrawdataset From github.com
Over 15 million players have contributed millions of drawings playing quick, draw! We cropped the raw images (or video frames) manually to make. All sketches were created by human users in a game in 20 seconds. The dataset contains 200 persons, each of which has one sketch and two photos.

<p>In this dataset, there are 1,000 outdoor images and each is paired with 5 human drawings (5,000 drawings in total). Conventional methods for this task often rely on the availability of the temporal order of sketch strokes, additional cues acquired from different modalities and supervised augmentation of sketch datasets with real images, which also limit the applicability and feasibility of these methods in real scenarios.

<p>To accommodate our research on contour drawings, we collect a dataset containing 5000 drawings (sec2). In this dataset, there are 1,000 outdoor images and each is paired with 5 human drawings (5,000 drawings in total). Today, i want to examine photo sketching in python with gan that helps to create such new images. The dataset contains 200 persons, each of which has one sketch and two photos. Using Google's Quickdraw to create an MNIST style dataset.</p>

<p>The drawings were captured as timestamped vectors, tagged with metadata including what the player was asked to draw and in which country the player was located.\n \n example drawings:. Cuhk face sketch database (cufs) is for research on face sketch synthesis and face sketch recognition. Conventional methods for this task often rely on the availability of the temporal order of sketch strokes, additional cues acquired from different modalities and supervised augmentation of sketch datasets with real images, which also limit the applicability and feasibility of these methods in real scenarios. Quickdraw, a dataset of vector drawings obtained by the quick, draw! What I found on google's quick draw dataset under 'faces.</p>
