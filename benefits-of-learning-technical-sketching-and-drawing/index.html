The Science-Backed Ways That Sketch Drawing Improves Mood From invaluable.com
Comparing with mechanical drawing, the use of freehand sketching in engineering communication provides the following advantages: If you can manage it, then a 3d view, (called isometric view,) will give most none engineering people a better idea of your object. It is a difficult task to ‘freestyle’ a complex design out of midair without hashing out the details. Manipulating and grabbing with the hands is perfect for helping them develop motor skills.
