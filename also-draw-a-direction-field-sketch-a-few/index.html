How To Sketch Direction Fields — Krista King Math | Online Math Help From kristakingmath.com
Recall that newton’s second lawof motion can be written as where f(t,v) is the sum of forces that act on the object and may be a function of the time t and the velocity of the object, v.so v is the dependent variable and t is the independent variable. Also draw a direction field, sketch a few of the trajectories, and describe the behavior of the solutions as t approaches infinity. C.find the general solution of. (c) for the trajectory in part (b) sketch the graphs of versus and of versus on the same set of axes.
