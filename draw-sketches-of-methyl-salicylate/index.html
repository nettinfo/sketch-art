Methyl salicylate is a phenol with a acetyl group in the ortho position. It is a colorless, viscous liquid with a sweet, fruity odor reminiscent of root beer, but often associatively. It is a bha found as a natural compound in plants. Methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen) is also a commonly known analgesic in the pharmaceutical industry.
