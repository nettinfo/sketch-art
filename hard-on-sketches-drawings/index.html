Since it&#39;s a hobby of mine i created a youtube channel where i am going to post my videos. If you like anime and manga, of course you want to draw. I had to leave sketching and study so hard so as to make good grades. In grade one, i nearly dumped sketching because i had lots of school work, and i had these intelligent friends that i did not want to lose.
