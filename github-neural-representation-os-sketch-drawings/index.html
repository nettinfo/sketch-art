<p>The recent prevalence of touchscreen devices has made sketch creation a much easier task than ever and consequently made sketch. Topics → collections → trending → learning lab → open source guides → connect with others. In our recent paper, “a neural representation of sketch drawings”, we present a generative recurrent neural network capable of producing sketches of common objects, with the goal of training a machine to draw and generalize abstract concepts in a manner similar to humans. It has been used from ancient times to today, comes naturally to children before writing, and transcends language barriers.</p>
