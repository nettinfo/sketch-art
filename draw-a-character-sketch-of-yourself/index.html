Pin by Kelsey McCarter on Charecter Disney character art From pinterest.com
For example, for your character‚Äôs shirt, draw the sleeves over their arms and the body of the shirt over their torso. A character sketch gives a complete view of yourself and we can change ourselves if there are any negatives that we have because while writing a character sketch we need to be true to ourselves so that we are cheating our own inner self because then only you change yourself and become a better person otherwise you will stay were you are and will never be able to grow in life. Bholi was a simple, but sensitive girl. &#39;speed lines&#39; and &#39;focus lines&#39; make it look like your character is in motion.
