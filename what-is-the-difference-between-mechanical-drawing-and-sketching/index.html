They are most used when producing drawings to be etched on to metal printing plates an example is *the section plane line, consisting of a centerline with its ends marked a and an arrow showing the direction of viewing to obtain the sectional view. This is a test on drafting techniques and the solidworks program. It helps people like me draw perfect circles and straight lines, and get things like perspective right. Architectural drawing, building, floor plans, installers, m&amp;e drawing are included in construction drawing.

<p>Drawing is the art or technique of representing an object or outlining a figure, plan, or sketch by means of lines. The key difference between drawing and drafting is that drafting has to be technical in nature, while drawing doesnât have to be technical. All 2d drafting in solidworks is parametric, what that means is that, if you make any change to the associated 3d model, the drawing auto gets updated. The 2d cad drafting is different than autocad in the sense that 2d cad drafting in solidworks is mainly for parts and assemblies whereas in autocad it can do anything. 3 Views Of Isometric Drawing at.</p>
