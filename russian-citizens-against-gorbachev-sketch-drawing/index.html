In the summer of 1989, neither helmut kohl nor i anticipated, of course, that everything would happen so fast. During the soviet era the russian soviet federated socialist republic (the r.s.f.s.r.) was subject to a series of soviet constitutions (1918, 1924, 1936, 1977), under which it nominally was a sovereign socialist state within (after 1936) a federal structure.</p>

The new state, called the russian federation, set off on the road to democracy and a market economy without any clear conception of how to complete such a transformation in the worldâs largest country. By 1991, gorbachev had become increasingly unpopular and, though he was still the leader of the ussr, no longer had much real control. The russian presidential election of june 1991 conferred legitimacy on the office, whereas gorbachev had eschewed such an election and had had himself appointed by the soviet parliament.
