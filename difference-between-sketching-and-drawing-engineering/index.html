<p>An engineering drawing is a type of technical drawing used to define the requirements or engineering products or components. It is a form of graphic expression. Today, the engineer should know the language of graphics and develop the 3d imagination especially when it comes to design or model mechanical pieces.

<p>This is especially true for the engineer. Cad drafting services is a technology that had prevailed in the construction industry in the way back to 1960s that helped the draftsmen to prepare building model on computerized software called as autocad which depicted accurate detailing in the model and need not require the larger sheet to be stored for every drawing that was made. The implication is that a plot is exact or somehow determined, where a drawing can be freeform. Drawing, some key differences set the two of them apart. Engineering graphics free hand sketch.</p>
