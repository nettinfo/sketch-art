<p>Uncheck allow 3d sketching of lines and splines in the design preferences That didn't work for me when i tried it. If you sketch the endpoints of the two lines on their respective planes, you can use 3d fit spline or bridging curve tools to make a line between the two endpoints (thanks @mbartlett21 for mentioning this): Fusion 360 line tool | fusion 360 line angle | fusion 360 sketch line. cad Fusion360 How do I fill these sketch planes into a.</p>

<p>Uncheck the 3d sketch option in the sketch palette. If it's on another surface, use the project command (p is the hotkey) and select the lines you'd like to use. In this list, i have compiled my favourite fusion 360 tips and shortcuts that you should definitely use in your drawing workflow. This helps to push/pull but the problem is the single line segments still stay disconnected. Fusion360 survival guide.</p>
