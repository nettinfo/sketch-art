<p>Onshape automatically translates the file to the proper format and creates a new tab for the file, as well as a drawing, using the file name as the file tab name and the drawing tab name. As a result, we often rely on documenting a piece of geometry with multiple specific dimensions placed on the drawing. In a sketch that is in a solidworks part file, a sketch entity (lines and circles are the most common ones) with a centerline linetype are always considered construction geometry. This is the place to start! How can I edit the required lines in the Exercise Update.</p>
