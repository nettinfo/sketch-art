Draw distance time graph of an object for the following From brainly.in
Absorbance does not have units since it is the negative logarithm of a percent.) But the more you play with it, the more it will learn. Two experiments were done to obtain absorbance versus time data for the reaction: I was told to draw a graph of vertical displacement, y, versus time, t, in 2sec increments from 0 to 1.8.
