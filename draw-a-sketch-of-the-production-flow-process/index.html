<p>Analysis of part drawing and assembly drawing this is the basis of the machining, […] It can be used to work out the composition of larger, more finished works. It is to be noted at the outset that the process may produce as joint products both goods and services (which are desired by consumers) and commodities such as pol­lution (which is not desired by consumers).
