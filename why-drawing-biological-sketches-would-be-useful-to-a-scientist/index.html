Some drawings for scientific use on Behance From behance.net
The ability to draw, label and annotate biological specimens is an important and useful biological skill. A scientist sketches to record and communicate information, not to make art. A biological drawing must bear all relevant. Drawing is a very important skill in biology and is considered a type of data collection because drawings help to record data from specimens.
